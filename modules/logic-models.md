## What is a Logic Model?

A logic model is a structured description of how a program is expected to work—linking what you invest (inputs) to what you produce/deliver (outputs) to the changes you expect to see (outcomes).

- **Inputs:** The resources used to run the program (e.g., staff time, funding, systems, partnerships, authority, data).
- **Outputs:** The direct products/services delivered (e.g., trainings conducted, inspections completed, grants awarded, case plans created).
- **Outcomes:** The changes expected as a result—typically in knowledge, behavior, conditions, or systems (e.g., improved compliance, reduced processing time, increased employment, safer communities).

A strong logic model also makes explicit the **assumptions** and **context** that must hold true for outputs to translate into outcomes.

#### Quick visual: how a logic model flows

### Special emphasis: “Causal impact” claims

In many settings, a logic model is used simply to map expectations (what we do and what we hope happens). But sometimes the logic model is making a stronger claim:

- **Causal impact (special category):** The logic model explicitly presumes outputs are CAUSING changes in outcomes. In other words, it’s not just “outputs are associated with outcomes” or “outputs support outcomes,” but “because we delivered these outputs, the outcomes changed.”

This distinction matters because causal impact claims require stronger justification (credible mechanisms, assumptions, and ideally evidence or an evaluation design).

### Why use a Logic Model?

Logic models help program managers and stakeholders:

- **Clarify program design** - Forces clear thinking about how change happens
- **Communicate with stakeholders** - Provides a shared understanding of the program
- **Improve programs** - Reveals assumptions that can be tested
- **Guide evaluation** - Identifies what to measure and when
- **Support accountability** - Shows the connection between investments and results

## Core Components of a Logic Model

A standard logic model flows from left to right and includes four main components:

### 1. Inputs (Resources)

Inputs are the resources dedicated to or consumed by the program. These include:

- **Funding** - Budget allocations, grants, fees
- **Staff** - Full-time employees, contractors, volunteers
- **Equipment** - Technology, vehicles, facilities
- **Materials** - Supplies, curriculum, data systems
- **Partnerships** - Collaborating organizations, expertise

**Key question:** What do we invest?

### 2. Activities

Activities are what the program does with the inputs to fulfill its mission. These are the actions, processes, and services that make up the program.

Examples include:

- Conducting training sessions
- Processing applications
- Providing case management
- Issuing permits
- Performing inspections

**Key question:** What do we do?

### 3. Outputs

Outputs are the direct products of program activities. They are typically quantifiable and within the program's control.

Examples include:

- Number of people trained
- Applications processed
- Inspections completed
- Reports published
- Services delivered

**Key question:** What do we produce?

### 4. Outcomes

Outcomes are the changes or benefits that result from the program. They occur in a sequence:

#### Short-term Outcomes (Learning)

Changes in knowledge, awareness, skills, or attitudes that occur relatively quickly.

- _Example: Participants understand proper food handling techniques_

#### Intermediate Outcomes (Action)

Changes in behavior, practice, or decision-making.

- _Example: Restaurant workers consistently follow food safety protocols_

#### Long-term Outcomes (Conditions)

Changes in conditions, status, or well-being that the program ultimately aims to achieve.

- _Example: Reduced incidence of foodborne illness in the community_

**Key question:** What changes do we expect?

### Optional: Impact

Some logic models also include a category for Impact, which represents the broader, systemic changes that occur over a longer time horizon.

- _Example: A healthier population with lower healthcare costs_

**Key question:** What is the ultimate change we seek?

## Outputs vs. Outcomes: Understanding the Difference

One of the most common challenges in performance management is confusing outputs with outcomes.

| Outputs              | Outcomes                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| What we produce      | What changes as a result   |
| Counts of activities | Measures of effect         |
| Within our control   | Influenced by many factors |
| Happen immediately   | Unfold over time           |

### Example: Job Training Program

| Component                | Example                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Output**               | 500 people completed job training                            |
| **Short-term Outcome**   | 450 gained new marketable skills                             |
| **Intermediate Outcome** | 300 obtained employment within 6 months                      |
| **Long-term Outcome**    | 250 retained employment for one year with increased earnings |

## Building a Logic Model: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Start with the End in Mind

Begin by clarifying the long-term outcomes and impact your program aims to achieve. Ask:

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- What would success look like?
- Who benefits from this program?

### Step 2: Work Backwards

Once you know where you want to end up, work backwards:

- What intermediate changes need to happen first?
- What short-term changes lead to those?
- What activities produce those short-term changes?
- What resources do we need for those activities?

### Step 3: Check the Logic

Review your model by reading it as "if-then" statements:

- IF we have these inputs, THEN we can conduct these activities
- IF we conduct these activities, THEN we will produce these outputs
- IF we produce these outputs, THEN participants will experience these outcomes

### Step 4: Identify Assumptions

Every logic model contains assumptions about how change happens. Make these explicit:

- What external factors need to be in place?
- What do we assume about our target population?
- What conditions are necessary for success?

### Step 5: Refine and Validate

Share your draft logic model with:

- Program staff who implement the work
- Stakeholders who have expectations
- Participants who experience the program
- Subject matter experts who understand the issue

### Key Assumptions

- Mentors will commit to the full program year
- Schools will support program access
- Youth will engage willingly with mentors
- Family support or at least non-interference

## Common Logic Model Formats - maybe, I dunno, maybe just delete

### Basic Linear Model

The most common format, reading left to right:

```
Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact
```

### Circular or Feedback Model

Shows how outcomes inform future inputs and activities, emphasizing continuous improvement.

### Nested Model

Used for complex initiatives with multiple program components, showing how sub-programs contribute to overall goals.

### Theory of Change Model

A more detailed version that explicitly includes assumptions, external factors, and the rationale for why change occurs.

## Using Logic Models for Performance Measurement

Once you have a logic model, you can use it to identify performance measures at each level:

| Component             | What to Measure         | Example Measure                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Inputs                | Resource utilization    | Percent of budget expended               |
| Activities            | Implementation fidelity | Number of sessions delivered as designed |
| Outputs               | Production              | Number of participants served            |
| Short-term Outcomes   | Learning                | Percent demonstrating knowledge gain     |
| Intermediate Outcomes | Behavior                | Percent applying new skills              |
| Long-term Outcomes    | Results                 | Percent achieving target condition       |

## Practice Exercise

Think of a program you work with or are familiar with. Draft a simple logic model by answering these questions:

1. **What is the program trying to achieve?** (Long-term outcome)
2. **What resources does the program have?** (Inputs)
3. **What does the program do?** (Activities)
4. **What does the program produce?** (Outputs)
5. **What changes do you expect to see?** (Short-term and intermediate outcomes)

---

## Key Takeaways

- A logic model visually shows how a program's resources and activities lead to intended results
- The five core components are: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact
- Outputs are what you produce; outcomes are the changes that result
- Building a logic model helps clarify program design and identify what to measure
- Logic models should be developed collaboratively and refined over time

---

## Knowledge Check

Test your understanding with these reflection questions:

1. What is the difference between an output and an outcome?
2. Why is it important to identify assumptions in a logic model?
3. How can a logic model help with program evaluation?
4. What are the benefits of working backwards when building a logic model?
